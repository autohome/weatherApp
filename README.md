## Description

This spectacular weather app was made to showcase Joshua Dadbin's skills in communicating with both server side and third party APIs via javascript. In true Josh fashion, he also paid great attention to detail on the CSS (with a little help from bootstrap) and HTML to create an easy and enjoyable UI which is visually pleasing.
